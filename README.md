# Data-Role-Implementation-Sample
I attempted the question samples given in the Data Role repository

To Run my Samples
- Please download the DataRole1.zip file
- The cleanup_label python code inside of the zip folder will require python.
- The output for cleanup and label part of this question is also available in export_dataframe.csv file.
- The cleanup_label file also outputs solution for Analysis part 1, which finds the average distance and standard deviation of each POI.
- The cleanup_label file is also available to view under cleanup_label.py file
- To test-run Anlaysis part 2 and Pipleline Dependency question, jupyter notebook will be required.
- The code and output for Analysis part 2 is avaiable under Analysis3.ipynb file
- Analysis3.ipynb files takes export_dataframe.csv file as one of its data frames, so it will require a path directory for the variable poi_analyis
- The variable poi_orginal in Analysis3.ipynb will also require a path directory to create a dataframe for POIList.
- I decided to attempt for 4b of Data Science/Engineering Tracks
- The code and output is available in Data Engineering.ipynb
- Data Engineering.ipynb will require jupyter notebook to run. 


ABOUT ME
I am currently a first-year student, studying Computer Science and Business Administration, with the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University. In my free time, I am searching for ways to combine my enthusiasm for technology and creative designing to develop products that can benefit others. I am curiosity-driven and passionate about learning. Specifically, I enjoy learning about potential innovation holds and how it is contributing to changing the world. Moreover, I have also been competing in soccer, table tennis, and track & field. A fun fact about me is that I am left-handed. 

Through this internship, I will build on technical skills to systematically organize, preprocess, explore, and transform data. It will allow me to create and contribute to data models for predicting the targeted audience behaviour. This internship will give me direct exposure to complex problems; through which I will develop techniques for breaking problems into manageable steps, and solving them creatively. Furthermore, through the work done in this internship, I will learn about ways to communicate the patterns and insights found to the decision-makers. Thus, this opportunity will help me build technical and communication skills.
