# Data-Role-Implementation-Sample
I attempted the question samples given in the Data Role repository

To Run my Samples
- Please download the DataRole1.zip file
- The cleanup_label python code inside of the zip folder will require python.
- The output for cleanup and label part of this question is also available in export_dataframe.csv file.
- The cleanup_label file also outputs solution for Analysis part 1, which finds the average distance and standard deviation of each POI.
- The cleanup_label file is also available to view under cleanup_label.py file
- To test-run Anlaysis part 2 and Pipleline Dependency question, jupyter notebook will be required.
- The code and output for Analysis part 2 is avaiable under Analysis3.ipynb file
- Analysis3.ipynb files takes export_dataframe.csv file as one of its data frames, so it will require a path directory for the variable poi_analyis
- The variable poi_orginal in Analysis3.ipynb will also require a path directory to create a dataframe for POIList.
- I decided to attempt for 4b of Data Science/Engineering Tracks
- The code and output is available in Data Engineering.ipynb
- Data Engineering.ipynb will require jupyter notebook to run.
